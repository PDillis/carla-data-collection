# Data Collection with CARLA

The [CARLA](https://carla.org/) simulator is a leading platform for autonomous driving research based on the Unreal Engine 4.x and, most recently, [5.x](https://carla.org/2024/12/19/release-0.10.0/). It offers a realistic virtual environment for testing and developing autonomous systems. One of the key features of CARLA is its data collection functionality, which allows users to easily and transparently collect data during simulation runs.

This repository provides an overview of the CARLA simulator and its data collection capabilities in a clear and straightforward way. We want to make it as easy as possible to get started in using this exciting simulator for many different experiments in Computer Vision, not only in autonomous driving. As such, we will provide starting code to get used to obtaining data, as well as adding more complex scenarios, specifically aimed for more rigorous testing of autonomous driving systems.
